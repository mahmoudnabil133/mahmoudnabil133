## About Me

I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a strong background in backend development using Node.js. I have gained substantial knowledge in databases, data structures, and algorithms, and I actively solve problems on LeetCode. Recently, I was accepted into the ALX Africa internship, where I enhanced my understanding of software engineering fundamentals, networking, web development, system design, and problem-solving in data structures and algorithms. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer, leveraging my skills to build robust and scalable applications.
